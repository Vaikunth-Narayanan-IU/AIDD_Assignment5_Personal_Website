## üöÄ About This Project

This portfolio was built from scratch to be lightweight, fast, and fully responsive. The main goal was to create a central hub for my professional identity, providing easy access to my resume, projects, and contact information.

**Key Features:**
* **Theming:** Easily change the entire site's color scheme by editing the CSS variables in `style.css`.
* **Responsive Design:** A mobile-first approach ensures the site looks great on all devices, from phones to desktops.
* **Interactive Elements:** Subtle animations and a client-side form validation script enhance the user experience.
* **Pure Vanilla Stack:** Built with no external frameworks for maximum performance and simplicity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project was built using a classic, reliable stack:
* **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout (CSS Grid), and animations.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For DOM manipulation, form validation, and interactive effects.

## üîß Getting Started

To run this project locally on your machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    You can simply open the `index.html` file directly in a web browser like Chrome or Firefox. For the best experience (to avoid any potential CORS issues with local files), I recommend using a simple local server. If you use VS Code, the **Live Server** extension is a great option.
